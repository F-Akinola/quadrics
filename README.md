# quadrics

In mathematics, a quadric or quadric surface (quadric hypersurface in higher dimensions), is a generalization of conic sections (ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas).While it is quite straightforward to sketch the conic sections, sketching the quadric surfaces pose quite a challenge to longsuffering scholars who would otherwise love to visualize the dependence of the quadric surfaces on their respective parameters.
In an attempt to solve this problem, I have compiled functions to generate plots of quadric surfaces in an m - file using GNU Octave. 
The script contains functions to generate surface plots of 15 quadric surfaces. These include the fairly simple surfaces such as the paraboloid, hyperboloid, etc., and relatively complex surfaces such as the Klein bottle, the Mobius strip,whiney umbrella, etc.
By making adjustments to the parameters in my code, the effect of each parameter on the surface of interest can be observed.
